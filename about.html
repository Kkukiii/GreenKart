          <p>
            Welcome to <strong>GreenKart</strong> — your trusted destination for <em>fresh, organic, and sustainable grocery shopping</em>. 
            We are passionate about making healthy living more accessible and believe that every small step towards sustainability
            contributes to a greener planet.
          </p>

          <p>
            Our journey began with a simple idea — to bridge the gap between local farmers and health-conscious consumers.
            By cutting out unnecessary middlemen, we ensure that you receive farm-fresh produce at the best prices while 
            helping farmers get fair value for their hard work.
          </p>

          <p>
            At <strong>GreenKart</strong>, we take pride in being more than just an online grocery store.
            We are a community of people who care deeply about the environment and want to make mindful choices.
            From organic fruits and vegetables to eco-friendly packaging, every product you buy from us 
            supports a cleaner, healthier future.
          </p>
